        RANDOM RECIPIE BUTTON
// RECIPIE = a short description of the dish, the ingrediant list, a photo, and URL(probably want to attach url to photo)

//when user selects prefrences those prefrences are stored in var or somewhere
// when user hit generate random recipie button 
// those stored prefrences are used to search API
// AND saved in local storage

// when user returns to the page thier saved prefrencesare retrieved from local storage
//and selected on the page and a recipie is generated automatically

// error protection user must select some prefrences or a pop up is presented "must choose at least 1 prefference"

//when user chooses allergy prefrence those are Included 
// when user chooses meal prefrence those are Included
// when user chooses prefrences under food groups those prefrences are Excluded
// when user hits generate random recipie button 
//Then Only recipies that meet ALL criteria above are generated
// If there are no recipies that meet ALL criteria show "Sorry no Recipies Found -- try changing prefrences"

//When generate random recipie button is hit by user
// ONE recipie is shown above  
//if the user hits generate random button again 
// a new recipie is shown

//when user loads page if there is no name stored in local storage
// input field for name is displayed 
//if there is a name stored in local storage
//then display that name in html
//error protection AND a button that says "not you?" is presented underneath name

Optional/Future Improvement
//find the time of day and automatically change meal choice based on time [that can be overridden by user]
//give the user the option to save recipies on seperate html page 'saved recipies'


working on your own branch 
switch to master 
git pull

git merge master
//this merges the updated master onto your branch
//this prevents old code from old master being pushed when you pull request your branch on github
